                On October 24, 2024, the MICS e-board held a meeting with <span class="highlight">Dr. Chita Das</span>, the head department chair for computer science at Penn State, and <span class="highlight">Dr. Griselda Conejo Lopez</span>, a professor for CMPSC 131. This meeting provided a unique opportunity to discuss initiatives for enhancing diversity and staying connected with the computer science department.
            </p>
            <p>
                <span class="highlight">Dr. Chita Das</span> highlighted the importance of improving diversity within the computer science field. Currently, women represent about <span class="highlight">14%</span> of computer science students, while underrepresented groups make up only about <span class="highlight">5%</span>. He expressed his commitment to supporting efforts that attract more women and underrepresented students to the program.
            </p>
            <p>
                Dr. Das also emphasized the importance of staying connected with the computer science department. He offered to provide <span class="highlight">several names</span> to expand our network and encouraged us to reach out if we need any assistance from the department. Additionally, he mentioned that the department would be open to hosting a <span class="highlight">presentation</span> by MICS if needed.
            </p>
            <p>
                Dr. Das suggested an exciting initiative to <span class="highlight">reach out to high schools</span>. He proposed creating a new e-board position dedicated to visiting high schools, sharing information about Penn State and MICS, and encouraging prospective students to consider joining the program. He assured us that the computer science department would <span class="highlight">support these outreach efforts</span>.
            </p>
            <p>
                During the meeting, <span class="highlight">Dr. Conejo Lopez</span> shared ideas about connecting with current students. She invited us to attend her <span class="highlight">recitations</span> during the first week of classes to engage with CMPSC 131 students and introduce them to MICS. Additionally, <span class="highlight">Josiah</span>, our Employee Outreach Director, raised the idea of finding ways to reach out to <span class="highlight">DUS (Division of Undergraduate Studies)</span> students. Dr. Das encouraged us to share our ideas for this initiative as well.
            </p>
            <p>
                This meeting marked an important step toward strengthening our relationship with the computer science department and developing strategies to grow MICS while fostering a more <span class="highlight">inclusive community</span>. We look forward to implementing these ideas and keeping the MICS community informed about our progress.
            </p>
